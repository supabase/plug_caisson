# PlugCaisson

An Elixir `Plug.Parsers` body reader that supports compressed payloads. Supports gzip, brotli, and [more](#supported-algorithms).

## Installation

Add `:plug_caisson` to dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:plug_caisson, "~> 0.1.1"},
    # optional, for brotli support
    {:brotli, "~> 0.3.2"},
    # optional, for zstd support
    {:ezstd, "~> 1.0"},
  ]
end
```

And then add `{PlugCaisson, :read_body, []}` as a `:body_reader` to your `Plug.Parsers`:

```elixir
plug Plug.Parsers,
  parsers: [:urlencoded, :json],
  body_reader: {PlugCaisson, :read_body, []},
  length: 8_000_000
```

All options passed to the plug are forwarded to [`Plug.Conn.read_body/2`](https://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Conn.html#read_body/2).

### Supported algorithms

- `gzip` - GNU zip - most common compression algorithm used in HTTP - [RFC 1952][]
- `deflate` - DEFLATE compressed data ([RFC 1951][]) wrapped in Zlib data format
  ([RFC 1950][])
- `br` (requires optional `:brotli` dependency) - Brotli algorithm developed by
  Google and supported by most browsers nowadays - [RFC 7932][]
- `zstd` (requires optional `:ezstd` dependency)[^1] - Zstandard algorithm developed
  by Meta (Facebook) which provides faster compression/decompression times than
  Brotli, but worse compression ratio - [RFC 8478][]

    Do not support streaming decoding yet, because of lack support for such
    flow upstream, see [ezstd#11](https://github.com/silviucpp/ezstd/issues/11)
